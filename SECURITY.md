# Security Policy

I, Dennis James Stelmach, offer no guarantees on the security of this application. I am not a professional developer, but I am following modern principles to keep this project as safe as possible so everyone can use it without fear of breaches.

## Supported Version

Due to the nature of the API starter, it should be assumed that the latest commit of the main branch is the only supported version (Except for the `Shopping-Template` branch, which is static since it's final commit on 4 MAY 2021). Most older commits of the main branch are checkpoints for the addition of certain features, so should work, but have no guarantee.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please send me an email at dj@dstelmach.com to report any security vulnerabilities you may find. I hope for this project to be used by others, so fixing any security holes are a must.
